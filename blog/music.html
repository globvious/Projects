                <p>
                    The copy of Pertubator's Dangerous Days I ordered from Amazon showed up last week. I have listened to the album a whole bunch of times, but it sounds amazing on vinyl! It's really high quality, heavy vinyl too. Definitely worth it if you are a fan of Perturbator and vinyl.

                <h3>
                    New Daniel Deluxe Album
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I listened to the new album by Daniel Deluxe recently and was super impressed. I had enjoyed a lot of his other tracks, but the newest album is rad!

                    Check it out on <a href="https://danieldeluxe.bandcamp.com/">BandCamp</a>.
